# Scrabble Dabble
1st UW Full-Stack Coding Boot Camp group project

## The Assignment
For our first project we were to work in groups of four to build an application, deploy it to Github Pages and then present it to the class. The application requirements were as follows:
* Use two server-side APIs
* Use a CSS framework (other than Bootstrap)
* Use at least one new third-party API
* Have a polished UI
* Meet quality code standards
* Not use alerts, prompts or confirms
* Deploy to Github Pages

## The Team
Our team members were:
* Dustin Jackson, https://github.com/dustinjack99 (owner of Github repository)
* Jon Lee, https://github.com/enadan
* Eric Bossler, https://github.com/E-Bossler
* Austen Turner, https://github.com/austenpturner

## The Process
Our first order of business was deciding what to build. We agreed we wanted to build a game, so the next was coming up with an idea that would meet the requirements of the assignment while remaining inside the scope of our time and resources. After much deliberation we decided on a word scramble game and soon the construction of ScrabbleDabble was underway. We utilized the Github Projects kanban tool to keep track of tasks and split up the work. 

The next step was finding two APIs and a CSS framework to use. Because we were making a word game, it made sense for one of the APIs to be a dictionary API so we could check spelling. For the second we decided to have a little fun and incorporate a gif API to make the game more entertaining for the user. Later on we discovered the gif API also added an element of distraction. It made the timed game more challenging and tested the user's concentration. Since the layout and design of our application was pretty straighforward we wanted to use a simpler CSS framework. We decided to use Pure CSS and used it for our buttons, inputs, and tables. 

After selecting our APIs and framework we started working on the rules for game play, necessary HTML elements, page layout and JavaScript pseudo code. Initially the HTML consisted of a header, div to hold time and score, form with an input field and submit button, and a word bank table. Later on we added a container to hold a gif, a button to render all new tiles, as well as a landing page and a highscores page. We designed our application using a mobile-first responsive layout. On smaller screens the element are laid out vertically while on larger screens some elements adjust to display horizontally. Once we had a majority of our pseudo code written out we started in on adding behavior to our page and building a working game.

Writing the JavaScript we utilized a lot of the skills and knowledge we had gained from previous class assignments. For example we used fetch calls to return API objects, JS methods to access information inside the response objects and manipulate array content, event listeners to call functions when the user clicks on button elements, methods to make new HTML elements and append them to the page, as well as methods to set and get local storage values. While a lot of the functionality we used was familiar to us there were still quite a few challenging aspects. We had difficulty when it came to comparing user inputted letters to the displayed tiles, writing the functionality to replace consumed tiles, and utilizing local storage. However, we were able to work together to overcome the challenges and successfully build a functioning game. After some finishing touches to polish up the UI and make it pretty we were ready to present Scrabble Dabble to our class.
