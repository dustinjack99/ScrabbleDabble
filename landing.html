            <p class="rule">Using letter tiles from the scrabble tile bag, make as many words as you can in the time allowed. Once
                you use a letter tile it is removed from the tile bag.</p>
            <p class="rule">Try to use as many tiles as you can! The longer the word, the more points you will earn. Use all seven
                tiles to get an extra bonus!</p>
            <p class="rule">Can't spell a word out of the letters? That's okay, you can dump them back in the bag. However it will
                cost you a few points.</p>
            <p class="rule">After playing, save your score and take a look at the highscore page to see if you did better than last
                time.</p>
